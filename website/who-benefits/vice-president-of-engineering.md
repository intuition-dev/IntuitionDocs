As the vice president of engineering, Metabake is scalable for governing multiple apps. It offers solution to short-term needs. It allows you to supervise multiple IT projects as it is handled by various teams. Hence, it offers compactness. Also, it offers security and transparency.

If you have a big IT project looming, but don't have the number of engineers you need to tackle the work in the time frame that's been set. The best solution for this scenario is the Metabake low-code development platform.

There are some significant benefits to employing the Metabake platform. First, you can speed up your application development and delivery. Metabake development requires little to no coding, so it goes faster than traditional application development. Second, you don't necessarily need programmers to perform the work. There also isn't a need to staff up with programmers for this big project. You may be able to use the business expert who has the best understanding of the project's goals to create the application.

The Metabake low-code platform allows you to build six to ten times faster than traditional development, and this is because we're not creating code. Metabake allows for visually modeling an application and encompassing the full application life cycle. Everything from designing, development, and deployment is all handled within the platform.

# Why Metabake

Metabake is a smart way of creating user-effective front-end web and application development, using low-code programming. Instead of creating a web application from scratch that can be strenuous, and time-consuming, people decide to use Metabake as the perfect developer’s choice that has been built only to be edited and customized for special use according to a client’s demand.

## Metabake's goal is high development productivity, efficiency and effectiveness

Metabake's low-code platform simplifies the building of great software. It is generally preferred because of its smartness and the fact that it is easy to use, navigate, and edit. With drags and slides from the available options, extension and expansion are easier to handle.

### Metabake is the extensible low-code productivity tool that simplifies the process for building great software{.tag-line}

Basically, Metabake provides an environment for programmers to create application software through customized graphical configurations and interfaces instead of going through the whole stress of using the conventional mode of programming, writing codes from the scratch, when you could just build on a quality one.

Summarily, it helps software developers and tech operatives to excel at what they do; easier, cheaper, faster, and be more productive.

Metabake allows you to reduce your overall cost of development. Metabake allows different levels and types of developers within your organization to be able to build applications. So you don't need to have only expensive developers building your applications. The Metabake low-code platform allows you to build six to ten times faster than traditional development, and this is because we're not creating code. Metabake allows for visually modeling an application and encompassing the full application life cycle. Everything from designing, development, and deployment is all handled within the platform.

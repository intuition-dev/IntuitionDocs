In WebAdmin, you can edit screen app or content using markdown or pug - which won't let you pages become broken. It also can leverage  native Custom Elements/standard Web Components and use any framework. It allows you clone existing pages to write another post/page, upload images, custom write own layout in pug, etc.

Any app that you can write or use in HTML, .js/.ts or css/SASS can leverage INTUITION.DEV. Since it is only CSS/.js/HTML there is almost no learning curve.  If you need to catch up, we recommend this book: ‘Design and Build Websites’ by Jon Duckett.

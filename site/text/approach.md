In a future with increasing automation, citizen-developers have become more widespread. Nowadays almost everybody can pull out a form or a web app using low-code tools.
Unlike other low-code tools, this one is aimed at professional developers and uses a standard language: Pug. We started first with a static code generator and then added a WebAdmin that lets you edit - and then kept adding features and refactoring. We hope to make open source low code approach popular with professional developers.

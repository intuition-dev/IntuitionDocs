### Linus (creator of Linux) on developers getting lost:
"Even if the choice of C were to do *nothing 
but keep the C++ programmers out*, 
 that itself is a huge reason to use C."

# Part we - low-code status before the winter of 2020:
- 90% of developers will lose their job. eg: Is there a job where you develop a spreadsheet: but first someone has to tell you what kind of spreadsheet. 
- Citizen developers: No need to know loop, hashing, normalization, failover, timeout, bla, bla. 
- low-code is 10X cheaper and 10x quicker.
- Cuts: first expensive developers, or working on complex tech.
- EG: From Data Center to Cloud we had **90% budget cuts**. Or Mainframes, Minis. 
**Black swan**, if you graduated after 2003, you did not see this kind of a wave.

I provide a list of low-code in the 'Pillars' document.

# Part II: What movie has line: 
##  'You're already dead. Everybody dies, you know we believe it' 
![60%](pro/100linda.jpg)
First time it happened, we did nothing.

### Here is what I'll do to be in 10% of IT survivors: "my team and me will code quicker than citizen developers".

# The apocalypse of Backend

## CDN is cheaper and faster
- It's problematic with dynamic sites due to notorious cache invalidation
- A breeze to use with Static Generators
### CDN based services like Netlify are becoming standards

## And so is Text Search

# The apocalypse of Backend

## AWS, FireStore, and more

# The Current State Of Affairs

# JavaScript Fatigue
- A new JS Framework pops out approximately every week
- Some rampant cases of overengineering
- Excessive focus on JS. Relegating as secondary the DOM
- Neglecting users that opt for disabling JavaScript
- SEO :question:

---

# Front-End Cornucopia

## Not all is bad

- Build tools and compilers -  once a rarity on Front-end - are now part of the normal workflow
- PHP-based tools and overuse of dynamic approaches are starting to feel bloated an unnecesary in modern Front-end
- Web Components and AMP are gaining traction

# Front-end Cornucopia

## The JAM Stack

## The future is mobile. Every web app is a mobile app and every mobile app is a web app

## SPA and Mobile apps

A responsive web app can easily become machine compiled into IOS and Android. *As single code base*. 
It needs to be SAP (Single Page App) and if you are in a rush or have limited resources you should convert to Electorn first.

- [SPA WebApp](https://github.com/intuition-dev/mbMobile/tree/master/webReaderApp)
Notice that it is a symbolic link - same code base for all 3 apps

To save time do Electron first.

The last step is easy:

- [PhoneGap](https://github.com/intuition-dev/mbMobile)

You can of course add any needed native plugins from Cordova; but most apps don't need any.

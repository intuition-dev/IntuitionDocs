# CRUD

CRUD and the ViewModel is client-side. Here is an example app and a readme:
[examples/CRUD](https://github.com/intuition-dev/INTUITION/tree/master/examples/CRUD/www)

You can use an client side architecture you want. But I use ViewModel. The main point is that the ViewModel's data structures must match the View. And that binding is easy from View to the ViewModel


## Extension

The Chrome extension that lets you edit an INTUITION.DEV screen:

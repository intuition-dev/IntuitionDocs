# Deeper dive: CRUD 

## App

You can use any .js libraries / tools you like. But the default is our Typescript based 'ViewModel'. 
'ViewModel' is client side, runs in the browser and it's main functionality is 
that is must to map exactly to our Pug View/screen. ViewModel provides simple data structures so that the View can easily bind to it. 

Here is an example app and a readme:

The Chrome extension that lets you edit an INTUITION.DEV screen, such as our example CRUD app:

If you install our browser extension, you can edit any screen|page that has been developed in INTUITION.DEV.

You can run it yourself. In addition to the CRUD app, it also starts the WebAdmin app that allows you/users to edit.
```
    intu -c

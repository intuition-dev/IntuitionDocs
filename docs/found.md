# Foundation of INTUITION.DEV

## Pug

INTUITION.DEV uses Pug as the main programing language:
```pug
body
   h1 Pug - node template engine
   //- a comment in Puf
   #container.col
      p You are amazing
```

INTUITION.DEV leverages MetaBake (mbake) CLI: https://intuition-dev.github.io/mbCLI/#/
but you do not need to know the mbake CLI for INTUITION.DEV


## Starting a project

[Convert 'page' source to Pug](http://pug.mbake.org)


### Cross platform peak

Here is a phonegap app for build.phonegap.com:
- https://github.com/intuition-dev/mbMobile/tree/master/phoneGapReaderApp

Notice that the electron app:
- https://github.com/intuition-dev/mbMobile/tree/master/electronReaderApp
and webapp:
- https://github.com/intuition-dev/mbMobile/tree/master/webReaderApp
are symbolic link to the phonegapp app.

They are the same exact app.


We'll touch more on mobile in the advanced section.

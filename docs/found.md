# Foundation of INTUITION.DEV


## Pug

INTUITION.DEV uses Pug as the main programing language:
```pug
body
   h1 Pug - node template engine
   //- a comment in Puf
   #container.col
      p You are amazing
```

INTUITION.DEV leverages MetaBake (mbake) CLI: https://intuition-dev.github.io/mbCLI/#/
but you do not need to know the mbake CLI.

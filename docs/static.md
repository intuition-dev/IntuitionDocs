### API

IntuAPI docs are here:

These are remote calls, eg. for a file to be compiled.

## User Auth

User's editing: means that you need user-auth. User auth and registration is built into INTUITION.DEV.

Because it is Pug, it takes minimal effort to do AMP if needed. Or locale/i18n. Etc. Since it generator, you can generate anything.

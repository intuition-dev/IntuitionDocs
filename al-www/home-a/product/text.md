About our product

Our product offers the unique functionality of collecting the demand data in a way that makes the interview feel more like a conversation and storytelling, versus an interrogation or fill-in-the-blank questionnaire. We collect the data in order of the Demand Profile: Desired Future, Catalysts, Constraints, and Supply. The main goal of our product is to find out what is the demand that causes someone to buy a product?

## What people say after we complete a sprint

*“I’m one of the founders of the company, I’ve worked as CTO, head of product, and head of customer experience. And as I listened to these interviews, there were times when I thought I knew exactly what the customer would say. But I was surprised to hear what they actually said.”*

*“Being able to tell customer stories was missing from our communication internally and with investors. Having them will help us explain the value of our product more effectively.”*

## How will your teams change?

**- Become Creators of Insights**
Your team will become creators of insights.
When teams create insights together, everyone has a sense of ownership. This motivates them to use what they've learned in their work.
Your entire team will increase their skills at gathering data, modeling those data, and discovering market insights.

**- Create Clear Next Steps**
Your team will emerge from the Sprint with action items they created. This enables them to begin immediately working on what needs to get done.
The sprint's final day is when your team creates and assigns themselves actions items. It's also an opportunity for management to assist in the ideation and prioritization of these action items.

**- Have Strategic Alignment**
Marketing will know what emotions their messaging should evoke, when to reach consumers at the right time, and the keywords that help make your product stand out.
Product team will have data to support on-boarding, retainment, and feature prioritization.
Management & Strategy will know how to identify growth opportunities, what things your teams should not be working on.

**- Model Market Demand**
Jobs to be Done is a simple, yet powerful, way of understanding how demand is created, and how it's satisfied.
With this shared understanding, your team is equipped to have the right conversations, focus on work that is important for growth, and become more effective at building and marketing products that create value and excitement for customers.

**- Rocket Fuel for Innovation**
You can't build the products of tomorrow by studying only the needs associated with the products of today.
The insight created during this sprint is completely independent of any product. We will study demand at a level that is abstract enough for your innovation team to identify new markets and new products they can build.

**- Discover Growth Opportunities**
Some teams we've worked with were in the midst of 100% year over year growth. Others had hit a growth ceiling and struggled to regain momentum.
This Insight Sprint helps leaders of both fast growing or stagnating companies instill a growth mindset throughout the organization.

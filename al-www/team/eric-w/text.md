### Jobs to be Done, Competitive Research, Product Growth

I help businesses use Jobs to be Done thinking to design, market, and develop new prodcuts. 

I have been building and helping others build new products and services since 1998 -- serving as a developer, designer, manager, and executive on product teams in the transportation, manufacturing, and software industries. 

Along with my partner, Alan Klement, I have helped businesses like Netgear and Pipedrive conduct demand research and develop new products. I also work on improving the theory and methods associated with Jobs to be Done and Demand Thinking.

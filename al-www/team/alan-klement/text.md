### Demand Thinking & Jobs to be Done

I help teams and individuals become great at making and selling products that people will buy. My own experience as an entrepreneur and innovator is why I'm effective at helping others.

I've successfully applied Jobs to be Done theory and practices to my own businesses. I have also helped many others do the same.

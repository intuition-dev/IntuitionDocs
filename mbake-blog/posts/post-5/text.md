## Introducing Evelin. Creative UI Kit template for Webflow

The rich text element allows you to create and format headings, paragraphs,
block-quotes, images, and video all in one place instead of having to add and
format them individually. Just double-click and easily create content.

For dynamic content, add a rich text field to any collection and then connect
a rich text element to that field in the settings panel. Headings, paragraphs,
block-quotes, figures, images, and figure captions can all be styled.

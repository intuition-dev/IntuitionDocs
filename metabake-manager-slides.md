# We partner with you to develop faster and cheaper

# Fast, Cheap and Quality
## is it possible ?
## It is though traditionally that between these 3 things you can only have 2 and need to sacrifice the other.
### i.e: If you want a high quality app developed in a very short ammount of time, it will be expensive. Same as if you want it fast and cheap, then it would be at the cost of questionable quality.

# But, is this always the case?

---
# Think about evolution of computer science in the past decades
<!-- show picture of cardpunched computer -->

---

# Back in the days, a computer was so big and expensive and it took so many people to program it that they were considered a rarity confined to experimental laboratories. 
---

# Yet little by little and with every next wave of innovation computers became the smaller, faster, cheaper and more resilient ubicous devices that shape every corner of human technology nowadays.
---

## So yes, to build faster and cheaper it's possible if you do it in sync with a new wave of disruptive technological innovation. 

--- 

## Every 10 years approximately there has been some kind of tipping point in computer science that allowed dramatic increases in development speed and disruptive cost cuts.

--- 

## We are reaching again a new tipping point. And here at MetaBake we proudly consider us early adopters of the technology stacks that will shape the future of software development. 

# Fast, Cheap and Quality
## Explain how.

# Our approach

---

## We leverage the increasing automation and low-code high-productivity tools to help us develop faster and with less error-prone approaches
### This leads naturally to cheaper development costs as we are able to compress the time it takes from building a prototype and launching a final product.

---

# Iterative prototyping
## We believe in iterative development and continuous improvement. 
## In a true Agile flavour, our tools allows us to reuse and build the next step of development upon a previous one.

---

### We are continously building and improving a library of highly-reusable intelligent components in the style of AMP.

---

## Explain AMP approach

---

## This allows us to extend the usability life of a codebase with well tested and solid approaches.

---

# Front-End First
<!--Explain advantages of Front-End First approach
- We first make sure that we understand and deliver an efficient UI and UX for the client
- Then we develop the data structure and services needed as serverless back-end
 -->
## Costumer-centric approach

---

# Design as authority. 
## Mark a difference with statement design.

--- 

## Conversion rates of well designed websites
<!-- fletcher method?-->

--- 

# Serverless
<!-- explaing advantages of serverless approach
 - Fast integration
 - Lower maintenace Costs90%+ of cost in software development, is maintenance.
 - Increased data resilience
 - Unparalleled security

# What we can build together:

---

# Custom Mobile Apps and WebApps
<!--Talk about hybrid approach -->

---

# Light or Commercial CMS

<!-- No more wp headaches -->

---

# Websites
<!--
 - high quality design website with mobile-first approach
 - Material design best practices
 - Component based approach makes possible faster loading speed and lowers user bounce rate
 -->

---

# E-commerce
<!-- A custom CMS allows to develop E-commerce  -->
---

# SEO

<!--Our tech stack is highly SEO-friendly 
 - Show example of front matter pug vs raw html headers ?
 - Client Side Rendered Apps are penalized by crawlers ?
-->

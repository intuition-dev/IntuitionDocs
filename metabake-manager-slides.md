# We partner with you to develop faster and cheaper

# Fast, Cheap and Quality
## is it possible ?
## It is though traditionally that between these 3 things you can only have 2 and need to sacrifice the other.
### i.e: If you want a high quality app developed in a very short ammount of time, it will be expensive. Same as if you want it fast and cheap, then it would be at the cost of questionable quality.

# But, is this always the case?

---
# Think about evolution of computer science in the past decades
<!-- show picture of cardpunched computer -->

---

# Back in the days, a computer was so big and expensive and it took so many people to program it that they were considered a rarity confined to experimental laboratories. 
---

# Yet little by little and with every next wave of innovation computers became the smaller, faster, cheaper and more resilient ubicous devices that shape every corner of human technology.
---

## So yes, to build faster and cheaper it's possible if you do it in sync with a new wave of disruptive technological innovation. 

--- 

##Â Every 10 years approximately there has been somekind of tipping point in computer science that allowed dramatic increases in development speed and disruptive cost cuts.

--- 

## We are reaching again a new tipping point. And here at MetaBake we proudly consider us early adopters of the technology stacks that will shape the future of software development. 

# Fast, Cheap and Quality
## Explain how.

# Our approach

---

## We leverage the increasing automation and low-code high-productivity tools to help us develop faster and with less error-prone approaches
### This leads naturally to cheaper development costs as we are able to compress the time it takes from building a prototype and launching a final product.

---

# Iterative prototyping
## We believe in iterative development and continuous improvement. 
## In a true Agile flavour, our tools allows us to reuse and build the next step of development upon a previous one.
### Software behaves more as an evolving organism, shaped by desires and constraints.

# Dynamic data/CRUD/'ViewModel'


To extract an example CRUD web-app in the current folder:
```sh
mbake -u
```

It has a README.md in root of the website that you can glance.

For CRUD, we'll take it in steps. It should be easy, but somehow there is some wider knowledge needed.


## CRUD Step 1:

- You should know HTML Forms, default UI style is from http://github.com/kumailht/gridforms






Table, Forms, FireStore|DreamFactory and Validation, Auth

UI First

For back end we had to use something, so we used Google FireStore, so you'll have to review the docs on their site for any back end code.

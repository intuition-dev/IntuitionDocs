content_text: Metabake is a low-code programming for static generation such as Markdown, Pugs, etc. with an inclusion of dynamic data binding.
comment: Metabake, or mBake, as some prefer to call it, is specifically built and customized for developers; it is not a gui. We give the chance to let you use a text editor to build your content and code in a more customized build that is suitable for your usability. It enhances front-end software app development.

# MetaBake versus Other Low-Code Platforms
MetaBake is a low-code programming for static generation such as Markdown, Pugs, etc. with an inclusion of dynamic data binding.

MetaBake, or mBake, as some prefer to call it, is specifically built and customized for developers; it is not a gui. We give the chance to let you use a text editor to build your content and code in a more customized build that is suitable for your usability. It enhances front-end software app development.

## MetaBake is the extensible low-code productivity tool that simplifies the process for building great software{.tag-line}

A distinct characteristic of low-code programming, MetaBake has the unique ability of going with the development of a front-end before the backend. That way, it is easier to work on a backend while we keep the consciousness of a friendly user interface in mind.

It also allows a developer to create a user-guided development; not the other way aroundâ€¦ making you feel more comfortable and in charge of your development.

It is easily applicable to the development of a business process, database and for web application.
The MetaBake low-code platform allows you to build six to ten times faster than traditional development, and this is because we're not creating code. MetaBake allows for visually modeling an application and encompassing the full application life cycle. Everything from designing, development, and deployment is all handled within the platform.

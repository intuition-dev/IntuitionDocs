# MetaBake versus Other Low-Code Platforms
MetaBake is the extensible low-code productivity tool for application developers via static generation; with Pug, Markdown and more; including dynamic data binding. 

MetaBake, or mBake, as some prefer to call it, is specifically built and customized for developers; it is not a gui. We give the chance to let you use a text editor to build your content and code in a more customized build that is suitable for your usability. It enhances front-end software app development.


####  MetaBake is the open source extensible low-code productivity tool for programmers.

A distinct characteristic of low-code programming, MetaBake has the unique ability of going with the development of a front-end before the back-end. That way, it is easier to work on a back-end while we keep the consciousness of a friendly user interface in mind.

The MetaBake low-code platform allows you to build six to ten times faster than traditional development, and this is because we're not creating code. MetaBake allows for visually modeling an application and encompassing the full application life cycle. Everything from designing, development, and deployment is all handled within the platform.

*Some developers implement applications faster than others.*

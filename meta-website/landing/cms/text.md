# MetaBake&trade; versus WordPress and other CMS

WordPress has the largest chunk of WWW - and it is ~15 years old. In dog-years, that is a lot.
One issue a while back my team had with WP(Wordpress) is that some pages on some browsers did not render CSS properly. 
It turns out, the problem was that someone did not close a tag.

In Ruby, Jekyll is popular and in Go: Hugo.
Plan is to have MetaBacke baseCMS be the most popular static CMS.

- It is fully SEO and CDN based, including AMP.

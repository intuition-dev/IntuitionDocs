### Linus (creator of Linux) on overbuilding
"Even if the choice of C were to do *nothing 
but keep the C++ programmers out*, 
 that itself is a huge reason to use C."
- Sometimes an approach that adds value is what it avoids.

# Part I - low-code status by 2019/2020:
- # Within 18 months 90% of developers will lose their job. eg: Is there a job where you develop a spreadsheet: but first someone has to tell you what kind of spreadsheet. 
- Citizen developers: No need to know loop, hashing, normalization, failover, timeout, bla, bla. 
- low-code is 10X cheaper and 10x faster.
- Cuts are first for expensive developers, or working on complex tech.
- EG: From Data Center to Cloud we had **90% budget cuts**. Or Mainframes, Minis. 
**Black swan**, if you graduated after 2003, you did not see this.

# Part II: What movie has line: 
###  'You're already dead. Everybody dies, you know I believe it' 
![60%](pro/100linda.jpg)
First time it happened, I did nothing.

# Here is what I'll do to be in 10% of IT survivors: "my team and me will code faster than citizen developers".

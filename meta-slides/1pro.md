"even if the choice of C were to do *nothing* 
but keep the C++ programmers out, 
 that in itself would be a huge reason to use C."

# Part I - low-code status by 2019/2020:
- # Within 18 months 90% of developers will lose their job. eg: Is there a job where you develop a spreadsheet: but first someone has to tell you what kind of spreadsheet. 
- Citizen developers: No need to know loop, hashing, normalization, failover, timeout, bla, bla. 
- low-code is 10X cheaper and 10x faster.
- Cuts are first for expensive developers or working on complex tech.
- EG: From Data Center to Cloud we had **90% budget cuts**. Or Mainframes, Minis. 
**Black swan**, if you graduated after 2003. eg. Always had LAMP (Wordpress is 40% of www)

# Part II: What movie has line: 
###  'You're already dead. Everybody dies, you know I believe it' 
![60%](pro/linda.jpg)

# Here is what I'll do to be in 10% of IT survivors: "my team and me will code faster than citizen developers".

# MetaBake:
- ### Automatic programming
- ### Grunt, Gulp, but 10X
- ### Static generation
- ### low-code
- ### Declarative 
- ### UI First
- ### White collar
vs: I know how to use a spreadsheet

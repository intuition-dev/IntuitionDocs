## Iterations?!
![180% center](iterative.png)
Version 1.0 spec is followed by next version - majority of effort is after 1.0 release!
#### - What if users could maintain and build next version?

---

<!-- *template: invert -->
###  Low-code?
![70% center](truck.png)
Robots will replace drivers.
#### And majority of the 3GL programmers! Unless you also use a generator.

DEMO foundation

Simple plan in 3 steps:
## #1. Build something
## #2. Market it
## #3. Profit!

#### We'll skip step 1 for the moment.
#### Step 2 first. Then we'll go back to step 1 - build an app.

---
<!-- *template: invert -->
Step #2: SEO
#### - links coming in, eye balls, customers. 
#### - We need content. We need a CMS!
## No matter what app we build, you need a CMS.
#### Or a website. Or e-commerece: please enter credit card :-)

DEMO simple ( intu's API, make a new static page, keyboard, standard web component, SEO, call a 3rd party API, custom server api in javascript)

---

Promised step #1: App.

DEMO basic/CRUD ( View Model, Validation, SQL, Pug, VS Code, Citzen-developer!)

---
<!-- *template: invert -->
Promised step #1: App.

### Not web app! Mobile app!!

# OK! 
## But easier to teach in 2 steps.

DEMO advanced/Mobile ( Native, Electron, PhoneGap )

---

# Web App and Mobile App is same code

---

THE END.
Inuition.DEV: Low-code via generated code
 that end use can edit/maintain.
## Main features:
#### - Open Source
#### - Keyboard
#### - Standard Web Components
#### - Low-code for preofresional programers

---
Almost THE END, FAQ:
### - Q: What about .js frameworks (eg. React, Gatsby) ? 
## - Ans: We compare to low-code, not (.js) frameworks. The list we showed. 
### - But if you measure performance or benchmark comperative productivity of Intution.DEV against anything, please share.

---

### Offer - Take a paid($) rapid prototyping class, via Skype where:
### We build an app/product to your spec together,
##  that you could maintain by yourself!

Also: full docs are online in github, and at www.Inutition.DEV
# For example: npm i -g intu

---
Did you miss anything I showed? :
## - CMS
## - Standard Web Components
## - CRUD 
## - Custom API
## - PhoneGap
## - Maintanance iterations
---

# Software will eat the world.
#### We just need to make more of it: better and faster.

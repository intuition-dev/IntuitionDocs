## Iterations?!
![180% center](iterative.png)
Version 1.0 spec is followed by next version - majority of effort is after 1.0 release!
#### - What if users could maintain and build next version?

---

<!-- *template: invert -->
###  Low-code?
![60% center](truck.png)
Robots will replace drivers.
#### And majority of the 3GL programmers! : (Unless we programmers use a low-code generator)

#### INTUITION.DEV alternatives, low-code, but targeting citizen developers: 
- Coda_io
- Wix Corvid
- Airtable
- Bubble
- iCodeBetter
- MS PowerApps
- Oracle Visual Builder

Agenda/Demos:
### 1. Foundations Demo
### 2. A 3 step plan
### 3. Simple Demo
### 4. CRUD Demo
### 5. Advanced Demo

---

Foundation:

## - Sass / BootStrap default
## - Written in: ==Pug==
## - Static Generation
### - CDN (Cheaper, Faster)

==DEMO== foundation (mbake CLI, css, pug, get started)
Scrape: ( https://Pug.metabake.NET )

---
Simple plan in 3 steps:
## #1. Build something
## #2. Market it
## #3. Profit!

#### We'll skip step 1 for the moment.
#### Step 2 first. Then we'll go back to step 1 - build an app.
#### So #2, then #1 for teaching purpose only

---
<!-- *template: invert -->
Step #2 - SEO:
#### - People coming in, customers. 
#### - We need content: We need a CMS!
### No matter what app we build, you need a CMS. (Static is a plus)

==DEMO== simple ( intu's API, make a new static page, keyboard, standard web component, SEO, call a 3rd party API, custom server api in javascript)

---

Promised step #1: App.

==DEMO== CRUD ( ViewModel, Validation, SQL, Pug, VS Code, Citizen-developer, Edit ext!)

---
<!-- *template: invert -->
Promised step #1: App.

### Not web app! Mobile app!!

# OK! 
## But easier to teach in 2 steps.

==DEMO== advanced/Mobile 2 steps ( Native, Electron, PhoneGap )

---

# Web App and Mobile App is same code base.

---

THE END.
## Main differentiating features of INTUITION.DEV:
#### - Standard Web Components
#### - Open Source, in Pug
#### - Keyboard (arrow up WebComps)
#### - Low-code, for *professional* programmers (no limit as to what you build, not  a 90% solution)
#### - BootStrap as default

---
Almost THE END, FAQ:
#### What about .js frameworks (React, Vue, Ionic)? 
#### - Ans: We compare to low-code, not (.js) frameworks. The list we showed earlier. We look at .js frameworks as 'Blue Collar'.
#### But if you measure performance or benchmark comparative productivity of INTUITION.DEV against anything, please share or ask for help

---
How to get Started:

### Full docs are online in github, and at www.INTUITION.DEV
### For example: `npm i -g intu`

--- 

### Offer :arrow_right:: Take a paid($) rapid prototyping class, via Skype:
> We build an app/product to your spec together, that you could maintain by yourself!

---
Did you miss anything shown? 
### - CMS and 3 Steps (SEO)
### - Standard Web Components
### - CRUD (w/ ViewModel and APIs)
### - PhoneGap / Native is same
### - Maintenance iterations reduce cost
### - INTUITION is built in Pug language
---

## Software will eat the world. The digital revolution.
### We just need to make more software: better and faster, and with Robots. :smile:

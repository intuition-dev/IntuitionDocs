Life 3-step-plan:
## #1. Build something
## #2. Market it
## #3. Profit!

#### We'll skip step 1 for one moment.
#### Step 2 first. Then we'll go back to step 1 - build an app.

---

#### - People coming in, customers. 
#### - We need content: We need SEO!
### No matter what app we build, you need SEO. (Static is a plus)

==DEMO== SEO ( intu's API, make a new static page, keyboard, standard web component, SEO, call a 3rd party API, custom server api in javascript)

Promised step #1: App.

==DEMO== CRUD ( ViewModel, Validation, SQL, Pug, VS Code, Citizen-developer, Edit ext!)
